# Methodology / Implementation

This section outlines the methodology and implementation steps undertaken to build predictive models for student performance. The primary goal is to predict the final grade (G3) based on the preprocessed student attributes.

## 1. Feature and Target Definition

*   **Target Variable (y):** The final grade (`G3`) was selected as the target variable for prediction. This aligns with the project's objective of predicting student performance.
*   **Feature Variables (X):** All other preprocessed columns were considered as features. Crucially, the `G1` (first period grade) and `G2` (second period grade) were *excluded* from the feature set. This decision was made to address the challenge highlighted by the dataset creators: predicting `G3` without `G1` and `G2` is more difficult but significantly more useful for early intervention strategies. Including `G1` and `G2` would lead to models with artificially high performance due to their strong correlation with `G3`, but would not be practical for predicting future performance early in the academic year.

## 2. Data Splitting

The preprocessed dataset was split into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance on unseen data. A standard split of 80% for training and 20% for testing was used, with `random_state=42` to ensure reproducibility.

*   **Training Set:** Used to train the machine learning models.
*   **Testing Set:** Used to evaluate the performance of the trained models.

## 3. Model Selection and Training

Three distinct regression models were selected for their varying approaches to capturing relationships within the data. This diversity allows for a comparative analysis of their effectiveness in predicting student grades.

### a. Linear Regression

*   **Description:** A fundamental algorithm that models the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a linear equation to the observed data. It serves as a baseline model due to its simplicity and interpretability.
*   **Justification:** Provides a straightforward understanding of how each feature linearly influences the final grade. It helps in identifying the most significant linear relationships.

### b. Random Forest Regressor

*   **Description:** An ensemble learning method that operates by constructing a multitude of decision trees during training and outputting the mean prediction of the individual trees. It is known for its robustness against overfitting and ability to handle non-linear relationships.
*   **Justification:** Random Forests can capture complex interactions between features and are generally more accurate than single decision trees. Their ensemble nature reduces variance and improves generalization.

### c. Gradient Boosting Regressor

*   **Description:** Another ensemble technique that builds models in a stage-wise fashion, and it generalizes them by allowing optimization of an arbitrary differentiable loss function. It sequentially builds trees, with each new tree correcting errors made by previous ones.
*   **Justification:** Gradient Boosting models often achieve high predictive accuracy by iteratively improving upon weak learners. They are powerful for capturing intricate patterns in data.

## 4. Model Persistence

Each trained model was saved using the `joblib` library. This allows for the models to be loaded and used later for prediction without the need for retraining, facilitating consistent evaluation and potential deployment.

## 5. Tools and Libraries Used

*   **Pandas:** For data loading, manipulation, and preprocessing.
*   **Scikit-learn:** For data splitting (`train_test_split`), model implementation (LinearRegression, RandomForestRegressor, GradientBoostingRegressor), and evaluation metrics.
*   **Joblib:** For efficient saving and loading of trained machine learning models.
